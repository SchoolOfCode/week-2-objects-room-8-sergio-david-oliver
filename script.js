/* Key represents the property name of each item in the object
Objects in javascript are collections of key-value pairs. The for..in loop iterates over the keys of the object
Key holds the current property name (like "member1", "member2", etc.) 
ourTeam[key] accesses the value associated with that key.
  ourTeam["member1"] retrieves the object for "member1".
  ourTeam["member2"] retrieves the object for "member2".

Objects donâ€™t have numeric indices like arrays. Instead, they have named keys (member1, member2, etc.).
The for...in loop traverses these keys, and key holds each key's name as a string.
